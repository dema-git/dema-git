# Hi, I'm Vladyslav 👋

Backend / Full-Stack Developer with experience in building
and maintaining production systems. Strong focus on database performance,
data pipelines, and maintainable backend architectures.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python
- Django, FastAPI
- PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy
- HTMX
- Docker, GitLab
- Kafka, Airflow
- MinIO

## 🎯 Core Focus
- Database performance and query optimization
- Refactoring and evolving production schemas
- Data pipelines and event-driven architectures
- Maintainable and readable backend code
- Service-layer architecture and clean design

## 📂 Selected Projects

### 🔹 User Events Data Pipeline
🔗 **Repository:** *(coming soon)*  

Event-driven data pipeline where user sessions are generated by ML models,
streamed via Kafka, stored in object storage, normalized, and persisted
into PostgreSQL using Airflow DAGs.

**Key components:**
- ML-based session generation (LLaMA)
- Kafka for event streaming
- MinIO for batch storage
- Airflow DAGs triggered via API endpoints
- PostgreSQL as the final analytical store

**Tech:**  
`Python · FastAPI · Kafka · Airflow · MinIO · PostgreSQL · ML (LLaMA)`

### 🔹 Zero-Downtime Database Migrations *(in progress)*
🔗 **Repository:** *(coming soon)*  

Research and implementation of safe database schema evolution strategies
without service downtime. Focused on refactoring large production tables
into smaller, more maintainable structures.

**Planned approach:**
- Parallel old/new schemas
- Dual writes via Kafka
- Batch backfilling of historical data
- WAL / CDC-based consistency
- Gradual read-switch strategy

**Tech:**  
`PostgreSQL · Kafka · Alembic · Python · WAL / CDC concepts`

## 🛠 Engineering Practices
- Clear separation between API, service, and data layers
- Performance-aware SQL queries
- Defensive programming and structured error handling
- Refactoring legacy systems safely in production
- Writing maintainable and readable code
